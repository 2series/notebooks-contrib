# Community-Built Getting Started Tutorials

## Background Conceptual Understanding
- [Should You Use a CPU or a GPU Approach for Big Data Analytics? It Depends on the Workload](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwlZbkFLAmQ) (Pre-RAPIDS)
- [CUDA in your Python Parallel Programming on the GPU - William Horton @ PyBay Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9Ezk6d3IuY).  This overview covers the basics concepts of doing Parallel Programming on the GPU, and [briefly talks about RAPIDS' place in that pipeline](https://youtu.be/c9Ezk6d3IuY?t=647).  For new or curious users, it is great to see what RAPIDS' API abstracts you from having to do - like the C, low level CUDA, and manual memory management - and lets you just do the data science in the py data stack that you love!
